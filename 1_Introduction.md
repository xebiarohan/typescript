1. Superset of Javascript
    - build on top of javascript

2. Browser cannot directly execute Typescript

3. Typescript contains a compiler that compiles the code in Javascript and that code will get executed on browser

4. it turns the run time errors of Javascript into the compile time expcetions

5. Installation
    - Install nodeJS
    - we need npm to intall typescript
    - npm install -g typescript (installs typescript compiler)
    - compiling a typescript file
        - tsc <name-of-file>.ts
    
6. Advantages
    - Adds types to save from run time errors
    - Adds non javascript features like interfaces or Generics
    - Mega programming features like Decorators
    - Rich configuration Options

7. Javascript is dynamic typed means the data type of a variable can be changed whereas Typescript is statuc typed, once declared it cannot be changed.

8. Typescript types are checked during the compile time where as Javascript types are checked during the run time.
